# ExAndroidNativeEmu

This is a personal improved version of [AndroidNativeEmu](https://github.com/AeonLucid/AndroidNativeEmu).Allow running android elf code on pc.

## Difference between AndroidNativeEmu
 - Rewrite memory mapping module, fully support jemalloc
 - More debug utils, pretty printing for instruction and memory.
 - Some misc bug fix
 - Stop all runing when getting exception  instead of just skiping one emulator runing for easily bug detecting...
 - Support ELF DT_INIT call
 - Auto Load dependency so.
 - Auto generate /proc/\[pid\]/maps according to current memory map
 - Fix R_ARM_ABS32 relocation bug.
 - Use program header to load so instead of section header
 - Support Java reflection
 - Support self jobject parameter for native method and self jclass parameter for static native method
 
## TODO
 - Simulate linker TLS initialization.
 - Support well known virtual file like /proc/self/maps...
 - ~~Get rid of dependency on Section Header when loading ELF~~.
 
## Usage

> In the future this will be possible through pypi.

Make sure you are using python 3.7.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python example_jni.py`

> If you have trouble getting the `keystone-engine` dependency on Windows (as I did):
> 1. Clone their [repository](https://github.com/keystone-engine/keystone)
> 2. Open a terminal in `bindings/python`
> 3. Run `python setup.py install` (Make sure you are using python 3.7)
> 4. Download their `Windows - Core engine` package [here](http://www.keystone-engine.org/download/) for your python arch.
> 5. Put the `keystone.dll` in `C:\location_to_python\Lib\site-packages\keystone\`.

## Dependencies
